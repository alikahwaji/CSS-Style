Layout
Layout : visual hierarchy, again arrange elements to engage and direct the users eye.
Users start at the top left corner of the page and then scan from there. Start with your logo and then start with nav bar .
Vertical nav isn't really much used.
Then we put our main content, make sure the content reinforces the hierarchy use images that face in, place text appropriately, ect.

Grid: A structural guideline for organizing elements on the page. A system of horizontal and vertical lines, the vertical lines creats columns with gutters in between. And are used to proportionately distribute elemnts on the page.

Baselines are tough to implement, they work great when designing in graphics software, but the brower support is nil. Use it as a guideline and do your best to implement well.

Grids come in many shapes and sizes, 960 grid system used to be the standard, but more and more websites are leaving "fixed" grids behind.
With a fixed grid, the browser can get bigger (or smaller) and the grid will remain constent.

A fluid grid grows (or shrinks) with the browser window,columns are either added or dropped to better serve that size.
Absence has presence, incoporate whitespace.
