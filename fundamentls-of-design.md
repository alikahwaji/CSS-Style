You can mix and mingle :) but don't choose two fonts from the same style, don't choose two fonts from the same class .

"Contrast over harmony"

singal typeface is enough .


Font size, leading and weights, for body copy 16px is good for font size and for the headline 300% ,B-head body copy of 150% , Nav body copy at 100% . As for the byline text 75%.

Visual Hierarchy 101

We alawys need to set leading relatively, line-height: 1.5;

Another visual hierarchy tool is using bold/italic weights


Line-width, measured ic CPL which stand for characters per line 50-70 character per line inculding spaces is ideal.

is CSS we use max-width, for example if we are one a desktop and it set to 730px with font size of 22px that will give us 70-80 charater per line, while on mobile device it drops to 360 px and the font size to 19px in so we will have avg CPL 40-45 .

"Save the orphans & widows"

widow is single word on a line of text and an orphan is single line of text on a column or page.
